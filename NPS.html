    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed with a task-oriented, thematic structure. The 15 NPS questions are grouped into four logical categories: 'Getting Started', 'Account Management', 'Contributions & Claims', and 'Information & Services'. This structure helps users quickly find answers related to their specific goals. The primary interaction is a tab-based navigation system. Clicking a category tab reveals the relevant questions in an accordion format, which promotes progressive disclosure and prevents information overload. An introductory section provides context, and a donut chart visualizes the distribution of questions across these themes, giving a quick overview of common user concerns. A new 'Ask Gemini' section is included for users to ask free-form questions not covered in the static FAQ, adding dynamic, real-time knowledge retrieval and a powerful, personalized search experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Grouping of 15 NPS questions by theme. Goal: Show the thematic distribution of common user tasks. Viz/Presentation: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hovering over chart segments highlights the theme and shows the count. Justification: Provides an immediate visual summary of the main areas of user interest, setting the context for the application's structure. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Individual "How To" questions and their answers. Goal: Provide clear, step-by-step answers. Viz/Presentation: Accordion List (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Clicking a question expands to reveal the answer. Justification: This is a standard and highly effective UI pattern for FAQs. It keeps the interface clean and allows users to scan questions easily and dive into the details of only those they are interested in, preventing information overload. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for toggle functionality.
        - Report Info: Free-form NPS questions. Goal: Answer user questions beyond the predefined list. Viz/Presentation: Text input, a loading state, and a text output area for the answer and citations. Interaction: User types a question and clicks a button to get a response from the Gemini API. Justification: This adds a dynamic, powerful, and highly useful feature that enhances the app's utility significantly by offering real-time, grounded information. Library/Method: Gemini API via Fetch. -->

First, your contributions are eligible for a deduction of up to â‚¹1.5 lakh under **Section 80C**. Second, an additional deduction of up to â‚¹50,000 is available exclusively for NPS contributions under **Section 80CCD (1B)**. Finally, if you are a salaried employee, your employer's contributions (up to 10% of your basic salary + Dearness Allowance) are tax-deductible under **Section 80CCD (2)**. To claim these benefits, you must declare your contributions while filing your income tax return. Remember that the 60% lump sum at maturity is also tax-exempt, making NPS a powerful tax-saving tool."

To activate it, you need to call the CRA's toll-free number at 1800 2100 080. You will be prompted to enter your PRAN. After this, the system will guide you through a verification process by asking for a few personal details. Once your identity is confirmed, a new T-PIN will be generated and sent to your registered mobile number. This T-PIN is an extra layer of security and is useful for quickly getting information from the call center without needing to log in to the website."

On the login page of the <a href='https://cra-nsdl.com/CRA/' target='_blank' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>CRA portal</a>, click on the 'Forgot Password' link. You will be given two options for resetting it: using a secret question or an OTP. The OTP method is faster; you just need to enter your PRAN, date of birth, and then a captcha. An OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number and email ID. After entering the OTP, you can set a new password of your choice. It's recommended to choose a strong password that you can remember easily but is difficult for others to guess, and to change it periodically for security."

To do this, log in to your account on the <a href='https://cra-nsdl.com/CRA/' target='_blank' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>CRA portal</a>. Look for a section like 'Track Your Request Status' or 'Grievance & Enquiry'. You will need to enter the acknowledgment number that you received when you submitted your claim. The portal will then display the current status of your request, including the date it was received and its stage of processing. This feature helps you stay informed about your application's progress and allows you to follow up if there are any delays."
